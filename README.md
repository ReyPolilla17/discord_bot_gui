# Discord Bot GUI

This is a revisiting of an old project I had. This project intends to have the following characteristics:

### GUI:
* Multi language support (english or spanish)

### Bot:
* Storing different bots to change more efficiently between them (also managing wich bots you have stored)
* The possibility to change the bot's name, image, description and status.
* Basic information of every slash command of the bot.
* Managing of every slash command (delete, update, etc.)

### Guilds / Servers:
* A preview of every server the bot is in.
* Information of every server such as user count, owner, creation date, join date, etc.
* Permissions of every server.
* Sending messages to one, multiple or every server.
* The possibility for the user to join any server the bot is in.
* The possibility to create an inivtation to any server.
* Knowing which test commands are registered in every server.

### Webhooks:
* Sending messages as a webhook.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to mention that this project is not intended to spy on servers, so it is not in my plans to add any functionality that can be served for this purpose.

## Project Information:
* This project has been developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), it is recomended to heve the latest version installed.
* The libaries I'm using for this project are [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) (v14.16.3) and [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) (v33.1.0).

> _Remember to run_ ``npm install`` _in the terminal after downloading the app to install all the libraries._

## Usage:
Since the project is starting, I don't have a clear idea on how the final product will look like, but in the futute, this section will be used to explain every functionality of the application.

## Notes:
There are many things I would like to develop in this project, so this document might change in the future... a lot.
