# Discord Bot GUI

This is a revisiting of an old project I had. This project intends to have the following characteristics:
* A preview of every server the bot is in.
* Information of every server such as user count, owner, creation date, etc.
* Permissions of every server.
* Sending messages to one, multiple or every server.
* The possibility for the user to join any server the bot is in.
* The possibility to create an inivtation to any server.
* The possibility to change the bot name, image, description and status.
* Basic information of every slash command of the bot.
* Managing of every slash command (delete, update, etc.)
* Knowing which test commands are registered in every server.
* Multi language support (english or spanish)
* Sending messages as a webhook.
